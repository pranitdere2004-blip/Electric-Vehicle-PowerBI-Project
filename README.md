# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Population Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** built using the Electric Vehicle Population dataset.  
The dashboard provides insights into electric vehicle adoption trends, vehicle types, model year distribution, and regional analysis.  
It helps stakeholders understand EV growth patterns and supports data-driven decisions related to sustainability and future transportation planning.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze overall electric vehicle population growth over the years  
- Understand distribution of EV types (BEV, PHEV, etc.)  
- Identify top states and cities with highest EV adoption  
- Analyze model year trends and manufacturer performance  
- Provide an interactive dashboard for analytical and decision-making purposes  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes key attributes related to electric vehicles such as:  
State, City, Model Year, Make, Model, Electric Vehicle Type, CAFV Eligibility, and Total Vehicle Count.  
This data enables geographical, temporal, and categorical analysis of EV adoption patterns.
